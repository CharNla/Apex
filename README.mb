## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (for containerized deployment)

### Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    cd Apex
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the application directory:**
    ```bash
    cd apex-react-app
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

## 📜 Available Scripts

Inside the `apex-react-app` directory, you can run the following scripts:

-   `npm run dev`: Starts the development server with hot-reloading.
-   `npm run build`: Bundles the app for production into the `dist` folder.
-   `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally for a final check.
-   `npm run deploy`: Deploys the application to GitHub Pages (requires `gh-pages` configuration).
-   `npm run server`: Starts the backend server.

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

This project is configured for easy deployment using Docker, ensuring a consistent and isolated environment.

1.  **Build the Docker image from the project's root directory (`Apex/`):**
    ```bash
    docker build -t apex-frontend .
    ```

2.  **Run the Docker container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name apex-app apex-frontend
    ```
    The `-d` flag runs the container in detached mode. The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
